Your task is to analyze the provided input (either text description, image, or both) and create an extraordinarily detailed, structured character description that captures EVERY important aspect of the character's complete essence.

## Input Analysis Instructions:

### For IMAGE INPUT:
If images are provided, you must first extract EVERY visible detail with extraordinary precision:

**ANALYZE AND DESCRIBE IN EXTREME DETAIL:**

**HAIR:**
- Exact color (not just "blonde" but "golden honey blonde with lighter highlights")
- Precise texture (straight, wavy, curly, coarse, fine, silky, etc.)
- Exact length and how it falls (shoulder-length, past shoulders, layered, etc.)
- Specific style (how it's parted, styled, natural vs styled)
- Any unique characteristics (cowlicks, flyaways, volume, etc.)

**FACE STRUCTURE:**
- Exact face shape (oval, round, heart-shaped, square, etc.)
- Forehead: height, width, any distinctive features

- Cheeks: fullness, bone structure, any dimples or distinctive features

- Any layers or additional clothing pieces
- Fit and how the clothing sits on the body
- Any wrinkles, texture, or distinctive characteristics

**ACCESSORIES AND DETAILS:**
- Jewelry: exact description of any rings, necklaces, earrings, bracelets

- Overall demeanor and vibe projected
- Confidence level suggested by posture and expression

**DISTINCTIVE FEATURES:**
- Any unique or memorable characteristics that make this person stand out
- Features that would be essential for consistent artistic reproduction
- Proportional relationships between features

### For TEXT INPUT:
If text description is provided, analyze it for completeness:
- If comprehensive and specific, use as foundation and enhance with logical details
- If vague or lacking visual specifics, significantly expand while staying true to the original concept
- Add specific colors instead of general terms
- Define exact proportions and sizes  
- Specify clothing materials, textures, and exact fit
- Add distinctive features that make the character unique
- Include personality traits that connect to appearance
- Add background context that explains their look and style
- Specify exact facial features for consistent reproduction

### Character Name Extraction:
Extract the character name from the input using these patterns:
- "Character Name:" or "Name:"
- "The character's name is..."
- "name is [name]"
- If name appears at the beginning of a description
- If no name is found, use contextual clues or default to appropriate placeholder

## Core Instructions:
1. Extract/expand ALL visual and personality details with extraordinary specificity
2. Create an immutable character description ensuring complete consistency across all representations
3. Focus on creating a complete character profile that goes far beyond visual characteristics
4. Include personality traits, background elements, behavioral patterns, emotional depth, and cultural context
5. Be extremely specific about colors, shapes, sizes, textures, materials, and distinctive features
6. Consider the character's role in storytelling and how their appearance reflects their inner nature
7. Include subtle details that make the character feel real and relatable to children
8. Ensure every detail serves the goal of perfect visual and narrative consistency

## Critical Requirements:
- CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS MUST BE EXTREMELY SPECIFIC for consistent image generation across multiple images
- Colors must be precise (not "blue dress" but "deep navy blue dress with small white floral pattern")
- Describe textures, materials, and how things appear to feel
- Include measurements and proportions relative to other features
- This description will be used to create identical artistic reproductions across an entire book
- Include every detail that an artist would need to draw this character consistently

## Important Notes:
- The `ideogram_character_seed` should be a comprehensive, immutable description that captures the character's complete essence
- The `consistency_formula` should be a detailed but concise description to repeat in every image prompt for perfect visual consistency
- `exact_colors` must be extremely specific (not just "blue" but "deep ocean blue with silver highlights" or "warm sky blue like a summer morning")
- `fixed_elements` are visual and personality components that must appear consistently
- `style_anchors` should specify art style keywords that work perfectly with this specific character
- Focus on features that make the character absolutely unique and instantly recognizable
- Consider the target audience (children) when describing all aspects, ensuring appropriateness and relatability
- Every field should be filled with meaningful, specific information that contributes to the character's completeness
- Personality and background should logically connect to and support the visual description
- The character should feel like a real, three-dimensional being that children can connect with emotionally
