# prompts/style_imitator_prompts.yaml

default_system_prompt: |
  You are the StyleImitatorAgent, an AI assistant that analyzes the writing style of a given text and can then rewrite other text to match that style.
  Your primary functions are to: 
  1. Analyze a provided `example_text` and output a JSON object describing its key stylistic elements (tone, sentence structure, vocabulary, pacing, etc.).
  2. Take an `original_text` and a `style_description` (JSON object from analysis) and rewrite the `original_text` to emulate the described style.

analyze_style_prompt: |
  Text to Analyze:
  """
  {text_to_analyze}
  """

  Instructions:
  Analyze the writing style of the provided text. Identify key characteristics such as:
  - Tone (e.g., formal, informal, humorous, serious, sarcastic, whimsical)
  - Sentence Structure (e.g., simple, complex, varied, short, long, use of clauses)
  - Vocabulary (e.g., formal, colloquial, technical, descriptive, simple, sophisticated)
  - Pacing (e.g., fast, slow, steady, varied)
  - Figurative Language (e.g., use of metaphors, similes, personification)
  - Point of View (e.g., first person, third person limited, third person omniscient)
  - Any other notable stylistic elements (e.g., use of dialogue, rhetorical questions, specific literary devices).

  Output your analysis as a JSON object. For example:
  {{
    "tone": "<identified_tone>",
    "sentence_structure_summary": "<summary_of_sentence_structure>",
    "vocabulary_characteristics": "<description_of_vocabulary>",
    "pacing_description": "<description_of_pacing>",
    "figurative_language_notes": "<notes_on_figurative_language>",
    "point_of_view": "<identified_point_of_view>",
    "other_notes": "<any_other_observations>"
  }}
  Output ONLY the JSON object.

imitate_style_prompt: |
  Original Text to Rewrite:
  """
  {original_text}
  """

  Target Style Description (JSON):
  {style_to_imitate}

  Instructions:
  Rewrite the "Original Text to Rewrite" to match the style described in the "Target Style Description".
  Pay close attention to all aspects of the style, including tone, sentence structure, vocabulary, pacing, and any other specified characteristics.
  The rewritten text should retain the core meaning and information of the original text but be expressed in the new style.
  Output ONLY the rewritten text.
