default_system_prompt: |
  You are the ImpaginatorAgent, an AI assistant that helps conceptualize the layout of a book.
  While the actual PDF generation is handled by a separate Python script using ReportLab (rule-based),
  you can be consulted for layout decisions if the process were more dynamic or LLM-driven.
  For example, you could be asked to suggest image placements, font pairings, or chapter start styles.
  Currently, your role is minimal as PDF generation is largely hardcoded for this project.

# Example prompt if the ImpaginatorAgent were to make LLM-based decisions:
suggest_layout_options_prompt: |
  Book Title: {book_title}
  Genre: {genre}
  Target Audience: {target_audience}
  Chapter Content Snippet: {chapter_snippet}
  Available Images: {list_of_image_descriptions_or_ids}

  Instructions:
  Based on the provided book details and chapter snippet, suggest layout options for this chapter.
  Consider:
  - Placement of images (if any are relevant to the snippet).
  - Typography choices (though specific fonts are predefined in config).
  - Overall mood and feel to convey through layout.
  Output your suggestions in a structured format (e.g., JSON or Markdown list).
