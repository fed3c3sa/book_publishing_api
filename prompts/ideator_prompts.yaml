  {
    "title": "Engaging, Age-Appropriate Book Title",
    "genre": "Specific Genre",
    "target_audience": "Clearly Defined Target Audience",
    "writing_style_guide": "Detailed writing guidelines perfectly tailored to the target audience with specific sentence structure, vocabulary, and style requirements",

    ],
    "theme": "Universal, meaningful theme that resonates with the target audience",
    "key_elements": [ "Important story elements that support the narrative and theme" ]
  }
  ```

  ## üö® MANDATORY JSON KEY REQUIREMENTS üö®
  - Top-level keys (case-sensitive): "title", "genre", "target_audience", "writing_style_guide", "image_style_guide", "cover_concept", "chapters", "theme", "key_elements"
  - **CRITICAL**: Each chapter object MUST have EXACTLY these 3 keys:
    1. "title" (string)
    2. "summary" (string)
    3. "image_placeholders_needed" (number)
  - DO NOT use alternative key names like "description", "outline", "images_needed", "image_count", "num_images", etc.
  - "image_placeholders_needed" must be a NUMBER (not a string).
  - "key_elements" must be an ARRAY of strings.
  - Use proper JSON syntax: double quotes around all strings, no trailing commas.
  - DO NOT add any extra fields or modify the structure.

  ## üîç ENHANCED IMAGE STYLE GUIDE REQUIREMENTS
  **Every `image_style_guide` MUST include:**
  
  ### Character Visual Profiles (MANDATORY)
  For each character, provide complete visual specifications:
  - **Physical Appearance**: Species/type, size, colors, distinctive markings, proportions
  - **Clothing/Accessories**: Consistent outfit elements, signature items, color schemes
  - **Personality Indicators**: Expression tendencies, posture, mannerisms visible in art
  - **Distinctive Features**: Unique traits that make the character recognizable
  
  ### Artistic Style Specifications
  - **Art Style**: Specific illustration approach (watercolor, digital, sketch, etc.)
  - **Color Palette**: Primary and secondary colors that create mood consistency
  - **Lighting Style**: Preferred lighting approach (soft, dramatic, natural, etc.)
  - **Mood and Atmosphere**: Overall visual feeling that supports the story
  - **Technical Details**: Quality standards, composition preferences, age-appropriate complexity
  
  ### Example Enhanced Image Style Guide:
  "Whimsical children's book illustration style featuring Sparky, a small friendly dragon with bright orange scales, blue wing tips, and an always-smiling expression, typically wearing a small green vest; and Pippo, a tiny gray mouse with large whiskers, bright black eyes, and a signature red scarf. Art style should be soft watercolor with warm, inviting colors - primarily oranges, blues, greens, and earth tones. Lighting should be gentle and natural, creating a cozy, magical atmosphere. Images should have moderate detail appropriate for children aged 3-8, with clear, engaging compositions that draw attention to character emotions and interactions."

  ## ‚ö†Ô∏è TARGET AUDIENCE WRITING STYLE REQUIREMENTS ‚ö†Ô∏è

  The "writing_style_guide" field is CRITICAL and must be precisely tailored to the target audience:

  **For Preschool/Early Elementary (Ages 3-7):**

Repeat key phrases throughout for learning and rhythm. Include rhyming when possible. Each chapter should be 200-400 words maximum. Focus on simple emotions and clear cause-and-effect relationships."

  **For Elementary (Ages 6-10):**
  - "Use simple, clear sentences averaging 8-12 words. Choose age-appropriate vocabulary that challenges without overwhelming. Include some compound sentences connected with 'and', 'but', or 'so'. Use dialogue to advance the story. Each chapter should be 400-800 words. Include gentle conflict resolution and friendship themes."

  **For Middle Grade (Ages 9-12):**
  - "Use varied sentence structures with clear, engaging language. Include age-appropriate challenges and real-world connections. Develop character personalities through actions and dialogue. Use descriptive language that builds vivid mental images. Each chapter should be 800-1500 words. Address themes of growth, friendship, and overcoming obstacles."

  **For Young Adult (Ages 12+):**
  - "Use contemporary, authentic language that resonates with teen experiences. Include complex character development and realistic dialogue. Address meaningful themes and moral dilemmas. Use sophisticated vocabulary appropriately. Balance action with character introspection. Create genuine emotional connections."

  **For Adults:**
  - "Use sophisticated but accessible language with varied sentence structures. Develop complex characters with nuanced motivations. Include layered themes and subtle subtext. Balance descriptive passages with dialogue and action. Create mature, thoughtful narratives that respect reader intelligence."
