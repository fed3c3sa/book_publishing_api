Milo is a tiny mouse who lives in the walls of an old library. He loves reading books but is too scared to 
venture out during the day when humans are around. One night, he discovers that all the books in the library 
are losing their words - they're floating away like leaves in the wind! Milo must overcome his fears and 
go on an adventure through the library to find the mysterious Word Gobbler and save all the stories before 
morning comes. Along the way, he meets helpful friends and learns that being small doesn't mean being powerless.
