# Language Model Configuration (Example using a local Ollama setup or a generic API endpoint)
# This would be specific to the LLM provider you choose.
llm_config:
  model_name: "llama3" # Or any other model compatible with your smolagents setup
  # For local Ollama (ensure Ollama is running and the model is pulled):
  # base_url: "http://localhost:11434/v1" # Standard OpenAI-compatible API endpoint for Ollama
  # api_key: "ollama" # Often not strictly required for local Ollama but good practice
  # For a generic OpenAI-compatible API:
  base_url: "http://localhost:1234/v1" # Placeholder, replace with your actual API base URL
  api_key: "not-needed" # Placeholder, replace with your actual API key if required
  # Other parameters like temperature, max_tokens can be added here if needed by InferenceClientModel
