  "image_prompt": "Willow, the wise tree spirit, appears to offer guidance to Ember, Maya, and Oliver. Willow's face is formed in the bark of an ancient willow tree, with twinkling amber sap eyes and a mouth shaped by the natural curves of the bark. Moss grows around her features like hair, and fireflies rest on her sprawling branches, casting a gentle glow. Ember, a small dragon with soft lavender scales, large amber eyes, and small growing wings, stands near Willow. She wears a golden bell around her neck and breathes colorful flower petals. Maya, a curious 6-year-old girl with curly brown hair, bright green eyes, and freckles, stands beside Ember. She wears a red dress with white polka dots, yellow rain boots, and carries a small backpack. Oliver, a 7-year-old boy with messy blonde hair and sky blue eyes, stands protectively near Maya, holding a wooden walking stick. He wears a green t-shirt, brown shorts, and hiking boots. The scene is set in a magical forest, with soft, warm light filtering through the trees, creating a calming and hopeful atmosphere.",
