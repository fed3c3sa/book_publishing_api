She breathes colorful flower petals, which include roses, daisies, and sunflowers, as Maya and Oliver encourage her. Maya, a curious 6-year-old girl with curly brown hair, bright green eyes, and freckles, stands to Ember's left. She wears a red dress with white polka dots, yellow rain boots, and carries a small backpack. Maya has a warm, encouraging smile. On Ember's right is Oliver, a 7-year-old boy with messy blonde hair and sky blue eyes. He wears a green t-shirt, brown shorts, and hiking boots, holding a wooden walking stick with a determined, serious expression. The scene is set in a whimsical, magical forest with soft watercolor tones, capturing a supportive and motivational mood.",
