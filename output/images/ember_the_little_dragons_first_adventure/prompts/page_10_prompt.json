Ember is a small, young dragon with soft lavender scales, large amber eyes, small growing wings, and a golden bell around her neck. She breathes colorful flower petals and has a kind, gentle expression. Willow is an ancient, wise tree spirit with a face formed in the bark of an old willow tree. Her kind, twinkling eyes are made of amber sap, and her mouth is formed by the natural curves in the bark. Moss grows around her features like hair, and fireflies often rest on her branches.",
