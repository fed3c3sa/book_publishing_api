Ember, a small dragon with soft lavender scales, large amber eyes, and small growing wings, looks worried. She wears a golden bell around her neck and breathes colorful flower petals. Maya, a curious 6-year-old girl with curly brown hair, bright green eyes, and freckles, is wearing a red dress with white polka dots and yellow rain boots, carrying a small backpack. Oliver, a 7-year-old boy with messy blonde hair and sky blue eyes, is dressed in a green t-shirt, brown shorts, and hiking boots, holding a wooden walking stick with a serious expression. The scene is set in a fantasy children's book illustration style, using soft watercolors to create a warm and magical atmosphere.",
