Her distinctive orange and cream stripes, pink nose, and curious expression are highlighted by her blue collar with a silver bell. Beside her, Rose, a talking red rose flower with a kind face formed by her petals, stands with a wise and gentle demeanor. Her vibrant crimson red petals and lush forest green stem with small emerald green thorns add to her leadership presence. Sunny, a tall and cheerful sunflower with a big smile made of brown seeds at the center, stands nearby. His golden yellow petals and thick green stem exude optimism despite the looming storm.
