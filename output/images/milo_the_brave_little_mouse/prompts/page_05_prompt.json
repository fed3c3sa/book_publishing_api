  "image_prompt": "In a cozy library setting, the trio of Milo, Luna, and Pip follow a trail of floating letters through the dimly lit corridors. Milo, a tiny brown mouse with soft gray patches on his belly and ears, large curious dark eyes, small round glasses, a tiny blue vest with small white buttons, and a miniature satchel made from a thimble, leads the way with his whiskers twitching in curiosity. Luna, a wise old owl with shimmering silver and white feathers, bright golden eyes, a small reading monocle, and tiny scrolls tied to her feet, glides gently above, her eyes scanning the shadows. Pip, a cheerful bright green cricket with darker green stripes, tiny glowing antennae, and a matchstick harmonica, hops energetically beside Milo, his wings occasionally chirping softly. The library is filled with towering bookshelves casting long shadows, and the air is filled with gentle whispers. The scene is set in a warm magical atmosphere, with soft watercolor style capturing the adventurous and slightly eerie mood.",
