  "image_prompt": "Milo suggests they all read together, sharing stories with the Word Gobbler. The letters return to the books as they read. The scene features Milo, a tiny brown mouse with soft gray patches on his belly and ears, large curious dark eyes, small round glasses, a tiny blue vest with small white buttons, and a miniature satchel made from a thimble. His whiskers twitch as he reads with a kind, determined expression. Luna, a wise old owl with shimmering silver and pure white feathers, bright golden eyes, a small brass reading monocle, and tiny scrolls tied to her feet, sits nearby, speaking in gentle, thoughtful whispers. Pip, a cheerful bright green cricket with darker green stripes, tiny glowing soft yellow antennae, and a matchstick harmonica, chirps happily. The Word Gobbler, a gentle and sad creature made of swirling shadows and forgotten letters, with gentle purple eyes, resembling a cross between a cloud and a friendly ghost, is surrounded by floating letters like fireflies. The setting is a cozy library with warm, magical atmosphere, filled with books that glow softly as the letters return to them.",
