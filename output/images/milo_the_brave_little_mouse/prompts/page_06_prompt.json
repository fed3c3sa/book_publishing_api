  "image_prompt": "In a cozy library setting, Milo, Luna, and Pip encounter the Word Gobbler, a gentle shadow creature. Milo is a tiny brown mouse with soft gray patches on his belly and ears, large curious dark eyes, small round glasses, a tiny blue vest with small buttons, and a miniature satchel made from a thimble. Luna, a wise old owl, has silver and white feathers, bright golden eyes, a reading monocle, and tiny scrolls tied to her feet. Pip is a cheerful bright green cricket with darker green stripes, tiny glowing antennae, and a matchstick harmonica. The Word Gobbler is a medium-sized shadowy figure with a swirling misty charcoal gray form, gentle purple eyes, and is surrounded by floating letters in soft white and pale yellow. The scene is set in a shadowy corner of the library, with the Word Gobbler explaining it didn't mean to take the words, it just wanted to read them. The atmosphere is empathetic and understanding, with a warm magical glow from the floating letters.",
