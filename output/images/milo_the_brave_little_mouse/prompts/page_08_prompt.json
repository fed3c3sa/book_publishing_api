  "image_prompt": "The back cover illustration depicts Milo, Luna, Pip, and the Word Gobbler happily reading together in a cozy library setting. Milo, a tiny brown mouse with soft gray patches on his belly and ears, wears small round glasses, a tiny blue vest with small white buttons, and carries a miniature satchel made from a thimble. His large, curious dark eyes and kind, determined expression are highlighted as his whiskers twitch with excitement. Luna, a wise old owl with shimmering silver and white feathers, bright golden eyes, and a small brass reading monocle, perches on a bookshelf. Tiny scrolls are tied to her feet with brown leather ties, and her gentle, thoughtful expression is evident. Pip, a cheerful bright green cricket with darker green stripes and glowing soft yellow antennae, holds a matchstick harmonica. His small round black eyes and cheerful expression capture his energetic nature. The Word Gobbler, a gentle shadow creature made of swirling misty charcoal gray shadows and forgotten letters, has gentle purple eyes and a small, subtle smile. Floating letters in soft white and pale yellow surround him like fireflies. The characters are surrounded by books safely back on the shelves, creating a peaceful and content atmosphere.",
