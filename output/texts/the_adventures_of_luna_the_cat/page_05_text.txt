Dark clouds rolled in, oh so high, 
Luna looked up with a worried sigh. 
"Oh dear, oh dear," said Rose with a frown, 
"Will the storm make our petals fall down?" 
Sunny nodded, feeling the breeze, 
"Let's work together, everyone, please!" 
With courage and care, they hatched a plan, 
To keep the garden cheerful, as best as they can.
