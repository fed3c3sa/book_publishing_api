Deep in the forest, where the sunbeams play, 
Maya and Oliver danced away. 
But oh dear, they wandered too far, 
'Where are we?' whispered Oliver, 'Under this sparkling star.' 
Ember's eyes were wide, filled with worry and care, 
'We'll find our way back, together, I swear!' 
With a gentle breeze and a path unclear, 
They held hands tight, to chase away fear.
