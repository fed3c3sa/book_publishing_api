From way up high, Ember did see, 
The village below, as cozy as can be. 
'Look!' she chirped, with a joyful cheer, 
'We're almost home, no need to fear!' 
Maya and Oliver clapped with delight, 
'You did it, Ember! What a wonderful flight!' 
Proud of her wings, so strong and bright, 
Ember led them down, safe through the night.
