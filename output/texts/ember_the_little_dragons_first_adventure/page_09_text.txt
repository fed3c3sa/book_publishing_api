Back in the village, what a sight to see, 
Ember's bravery brought such glee! 
The children cheered and danced around, 
With petals and giggles all over the ground. 
'You're so special!' they all did say, 
'Being different makes you bright as day!' 
Ember smiled, her heart so light, 
Knowing she was loved, felt just right.
