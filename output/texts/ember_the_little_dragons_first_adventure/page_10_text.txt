Under Willow's gentle leaves, Ember rests with ease. 
Petals dance around her, like a soft, sweet breeze. 
'You are brave,' whispers Willow, in the quiet of the night, 
'Your heart is full of courage, shining oh so bright!' 
Ember's smile grows wide, feeling love all around, 
Knowing friends like Willow make her life profound.
