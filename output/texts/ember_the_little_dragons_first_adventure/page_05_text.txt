With a shimmer and a twinkle, Willow appeared, 
Her voice like a song, gentle and clear. 
'Ember, dear Ember, spread your wings wide, 
Soar above the trees, let the stars be your guide.' 
Maya and Oliver looked up with delight, 
'Fly high, dear Ember, into the night!' 
Ember's heart fluttered, courage began to grow, 
As Willow whispered, 'Trust yourself, let your spirit glow.'
